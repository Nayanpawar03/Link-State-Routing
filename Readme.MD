# 🌐 Link-State Routing Algorithm with Visualization

This project is a **Link-State Routing Algorithm** implementation using **Flask** and **NetworkX**. It allows users to visualize routers, links, and costs dynamically with an interactive interface.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Add and remove routers dynamically  
✅ Add, modify, and remove links with costs  
✅ Visualize the network graph in real-time  
✅ Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path  
✅ User-friendly web interface

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Flask, NetworkX, Matplotlib)
- **HTML/CSS** (For the frontend interface)
- **JavaScript** (AJAX for dynamic updates)
